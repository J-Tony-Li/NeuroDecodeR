\title{A maximum correlation coefficient classifier (CL) object}
\usage{
cl_max_correlation()
}
\description{
An implementation of a maximum correlation coefficeint classifier. Like all
classifiers (CL) objects, this classifier has a get_predictions() method which
learns a model based on training data and then makes predictions on the test
data.
}
\details{
This CL object learns a mean population vector (template) for each
class from the training set (by averaging together the all training points
within each class). The classifier is tested by calculated Pearsonâ€™s
correlation coefficient between a test point and the templates learned from
the training set, and the class with the highest correlation value is returned
as the predicted label. The decision values returned by the classifier are the
correlation coefficients between all test points and all templates.

# running a basic decoding analysis using the cl_max_correlation
