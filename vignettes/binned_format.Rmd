Binned-format data contains data from multiple sites (e.g., data from many
neurons, LFP channels, etc.). Data that is in binned-format is very similar to
data that is in raster-format except that it contains information from multiple
sites and often contains the information at a coarser resolution; for example,
binned data would typically contain firing rates over some time interval sampled
at a lower rate, as opposed to raster-format data that would typically contain
individual spikes sampled at a higher rate. Binned-format data is
typicallycreated from raster-format data using the function `create_binned_data`
which converts a directory of raster-format files into a binned-format file that
is useful for decoding.

Like rater-format data, binned-format data also contains two variables which
are: `binned_data`, and `binned_site_info` . More details about these variables
are described below and also see the documentation on
[raster-format](raster-format.html) for more information.



### binned_data

The data frame binned_data has the following variables

1. siteID A number indicating which site a given row of data corresponds to

1. labels.X  These variables contain labels of which experimental conditions occured on a given trial

2. time.X_Y  These variables contain data in a time range from X to Y

The number of rows in the data frame correspond to the number of trial in all experimental recording sessions across all sites.



### binned_site_info

The variable binned_site_info is list that contains any additional information about the sites. If the `created_binned_data` function was used to generate the data, then this is just combined from the raster_site info. 




## Example binned-format data

Below is an example of binned format data file from the [Zhang-Desimone 7 object data set](Zhang_Desimone_7_object_dataset.html) .


```{r load_raster_file}


load("ZD_150bins_50sampled.Rda")

head(binned_data[, 1:10])

head(binned_site_info, 2)


```
