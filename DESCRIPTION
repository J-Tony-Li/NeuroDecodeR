Description: A package that allows one to do a neural decoding analysis in R. 
    The package is based on 5 abstract object types: datasources (DS), 
    features preprocessors (FP), classifiers (CL), and result matrics (RM) 
    and cross-validators (CV). By combing different versions of these 4 object 
    types together, it is possible to run a range of different decoding
    analyses. See www.readout.info for more information.
