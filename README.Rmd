## Description:

The Neural Decoding Toolbox in R (NDTr) package allows one to do a neural
decoding analysis in R.

The package is based on 5 abstract object types: 

1. datasources (DS)
2. features preprocessors (FP)
3. classifiers (CL)
4. result metrics (RM) 
5. cross-validators (CV)


By combing different versions of these 4 objecttypes together, it is possible to
run a range of different decoding analyses. See www.readout.info for more
information.


## Installation

You can install NDTr from github using:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("emeyers/NDTr")
```
