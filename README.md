Description:
------------

A package that allows one to do a neural decoding analysis in R. The package is based on 4 abstract object types: datasources (DS), features preprocessors (FP), classifiers (CL), and cross-validators (CV). By combing different versions of these 4 object types together, it is possible to run a range of different decoding analyses. See www.readout.info for more information.
